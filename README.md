# python-tkinter-invoice-app
This is a very basic GUI based invoice app built with tkinter framework in python

# Some need to knows about the app

I understand that there is currently no way to delete or edit data in the database, but that is because this is intended for the user not the admin. Perhaps in the future I'll make an admin version of the app to make the admins manage users and all that.

Also note that there are still some security concerns about this app if you intend to use it in the real world. I just built it for fun not for a real life situation, so if you want to use it in a real life situation, please endeavor to upgrade some sections of the code and also to tell me what you modified.

# Versions of the app

Though the app is still in development, there are thus the online and the offline version of the app. They both use the Flask framework, but only the online version is hosted. If you don't come across the online version, it's because I haven't finished it yet. I don't have a lot of free time, so that's why, but you're free to work on it.
